/*
We are given an array containing n objects. Each object, when created, 
was assigned a unique number from the range 1 to n based on their creation sequence. 
This means that the object with sequence number 3 was 
created just before the object with sequence number 4.

Write a function to sort the objects in-place on their creation sequence number in O(n)
and without using any extra space. For simplicity, letâ€™s assume we are passed 
an integer array containing only the sequence numbers, 
though each number is actually an object.

Example 1:
  Input: [3, 1, 5, 4, 2]
  Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Example 2:
  Input: [2, 6, 4, 3, 1, 5]
  Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

Example 3:
  Input: [1, 5, 6, 4, 3, 2]
  Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
