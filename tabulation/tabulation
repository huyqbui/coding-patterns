Tabulation Recipe:

- Visualize the problem as a table 
- Size the table based on the inputs
- Initialize the table with default values (fill w/ correct types!)
  - ex. if asked to return number, fill table with numbers
- Seed the trivial answer into the table
- Iterate through the table
- Fill further positions based on the current position
