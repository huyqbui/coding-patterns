/*

You are visiting a farm to collect fruits. 
The farm has a single row of fruit trees. 
You will be given two baskets, and your goal is:
to pick as many fruits as possible to be placed in the given baskets.

You will be given an array of characters where each character represents a fruit tree. 
The farm has following restrictions:

Each basket can have only one type of fruit. 
There is no limit to how many fruit a basket can hold.
You can start with any tree, but you canâ€™t skip a tree once you have started.
You will pick exactly one fruit from every tree until you cannot, 
i.e., you will stop when you have to pick from a third fruit type.
Write a function to return the maximum number of fruits in both baskets.

Example 1:

Input: Fruit=['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'C']
Output: 3
Explanation: We can put 2 'C' in one basket and one 'A' in the other from the subarray ['C', 'A', 'C']
Example 2:

Input: Fruit=['A', 'B', 'C', 'B', 'B', 'C']
Output: 5
Explanation: We can put 3 'B' in one basket and two 'C' in the other basket. 
This can be done if we start with the second letter: ['B', 'C', 'B', 'B', 'C']

    currLength: number = 0,

  // iterate through fruits, adding each fruit into hashmap

    // compare currLength with maxLength, and reassign maxLength to w/e is greater

console.log(fruitsIntoBaskets(['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'C'])) // -> 3
console.log(fruitsIntoBaskets(['B', 'O', 'C', 'D', 'C', 'D', 'C', 'E'])) // -> 5
